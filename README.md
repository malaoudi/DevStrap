# DevStrap
Devstrap is a web application built as a reference tool for programmers. It summaries generic ways, tools and necessary documentations to create projects such as web applications, mobile applications and softwares. 

# Inspiration
One of our team members is a first time hackathon attendee. He has experience with algorithms and libraries but has always had a hard time starting from scratch with the basics. Devstrap aims to provide the best documentation for new developers who wish to take applications from nothing to a finished product.

# What it does
Devstrap provides all the necessary documentation aggregated for putting together projects from scratch. The documentation is paired along with a beautiful UI with pure CSS styling and minimal library usage.

# How we built it
We built this application using Vanilla JavaScript, express routing, HTML and CSS. We utilized REST APIs in order to build a smooth routing process for users. We implemented the edge cases and features required for good Authentication with Firebase.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we were able to develop a great looking application with complete functionality in a days time. We used Firebase for Authentications and Figma for storyboarding user interfaces.
We have added tracks for users where we keep track of their progress and or last lesson viewed. I also would ideally like to integrate something that makes the application feel like a community but we are not sure what yet.
